# Perceptron
A machine learning project implementing perceptron algorithm

This data set analyzes some liver disorders that might arise from excessive alcohol consumption (the first 5
features), and the number of half-pint equivalents of alcoholic beverages drunk per day for each individual.
The task is to select if a given individual suffers from alcoholism.
Evaluate the Perceptron implementation on the Bupa Liver Disorder dataset. The classification problem is to predict whether an individual has a liver disorder (indicated by
the selector feature) based on the results of a number of blood tests and levels of alcohol consumption. Use
90% of the dataset for training and 10% for testing.
